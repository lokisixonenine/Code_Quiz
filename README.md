# Code_Quiz

For this assignment, I will be creating a timed-code quiz made up of multiple-choice questions thatcan test a user's 
knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS. Each wrong answer will reduce the total amount of time given. The user's score is 
displayed when the user finishes or when the time runs out. 

Acceptance Criteria for this Assignment:
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question,
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorectly, 
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my intitials and score

This code quiz must be dynamic with a clean and polished interface and must adapt to multiple screen sizes.
